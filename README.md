# Golang-microservices

Go's standard library is a very powerful tool for building any type of microservices. Inspite of the complexity go community prefers building microservices with standard library.

# REST in go

## Product-api

This folder contains a simple REST implementation which helps in understanding the library and the fundamentals. Without using any sort of database but static data, implementation of http methods like GET, POST, PUT is performed in this.

## [Product-api using Gorilla](https://github.com/shashwatkoliwad/golang-microservices/tree/Gorilla-REST)

A similar implementation is also made using the Go's popular Gorilla framework. Gorilla framework abstracts out ServeHTTP handler for us. And I also have a middleware function just to understand the flow of how it works.
